I developed a **Number Guessing Game** using Java, where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and a limited number of attempts. The game includes features like custom range selection, attempt limits, input validation, and a replay option for multiple rounds. This project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and reinforce core Java concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
